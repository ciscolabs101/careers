# Console Culture

Our mission, values and approach to running [Console](https://console.dev).

## Mission

Console's mission is to help developers find the best tools.

Developers are an important group that make big decisions, yet they face an
onslaught of marketing and sales combined with an unrelenting velocity of
releases to keep up with. Our aim is to become the place developers go to find
the best tools. The independent voice that developers trust to help them
discover the best and most interesting tools.

[Read about our mission](https://blog.console.dev/focusing-on-developers/) and
  how the age of the developer is just getting started.

## Values

* Developer first
* Transparency
* Simplicity
* Considered discussion

### Developer first

Developer first means aiming to create a high-quality experience for developers
as the Prime Directive for everything we do. This flows into all our other
values: transparency (like the open-source hacker ethic), simplicity (like the
Unix philosophy), and considered discussion (like RFCs).

### Transparency

Following the [hacker ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic), open
access is the default. Internally, very few things are private. This means
documentation, metrics, and discussion are all open. Good decisions require all
the facts and we want our team to contribute their skill and experience at
solving problems.

#### We will

* Share key business metrics internally, such as costs and revenue.
* Explain and discuss what is going well and what isn't going so well.

#### We will not

* Share issues where we are one of several stakeholders e.g. team personal
  issues, or commercial agreements with our partners.

### Simplicity

Following the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy),
we should do only what is absolutely necessary, and do it well. Can you solve a
problem in less steps, do you really need this new tool to do the job? Strive
for simplicity in everything you do.

#### We will

* Build compact, minimalist, modular, well documented, well tested.
* Prototype and iterate, then polish and pay attention to the details.

#### We will not

* Create elaborate or cluttered visual UIs where text would work just as well.

### Considered discussion

There's a reason why scientific peer-review and
[RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) are important -
ideas are improved through debate and disagreement! This is not about being
difficult or confrontational, but by challenging in a friendly way and always
giving people the benefit of the doubt, we can improve how we do things.

#### We will

* Debate the idea, not the person.
* Actively encourage everyone to provide feedback without fear.

#### We will not

* Use an aggressive or overly adversarial approach to debating.

### How we run Console

#### Respect time

When we call a meeting, we respect that everyone's time is valuable. Meetings
should therefore be focused on the issues at hand, tightly run, and short. The
scheduled time is when the meeting starts, not when you begin to arrive.

#### Long term thinking

We don't mind sacrificing the short term for our longer term goals. Whether
this means declining short term revenue because the partner doesn't meet our
selection criteria or choosing the more expensive, but more environmentally
sustainable option, we are willing to think long term.

#### Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time

[Group chat is the best way to stress out your
team](https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems). Although we have and
use chat through Campfire in Basecamp, we use it primarily for socialising and
sharing interesting things. We prefer long-form posts as Basecamp Messages
rather than discussing things in chat.

We do not expect an immediate response (to chat or messages) and you can choose
when and whether to participate in any discussions. [If it will matter after
today](https://critter.blog/2021/01/12/if-it-matters-after-today-stop-talking-about-it-in-a-chat-room/),
don't put it in chat - create a message instead.

#### We will

* Use chat to socialise, share links, talk about general topics.
* Use Basecamp Messages for anything that everyone needs to see.

#### We will not

* Put anything important in chat or expect immediate attention.

### Pay attention to the details rather than aiming for perfectionism

Knowing when you're
[done](https://drewdevault.com/2021/01/04/A-culture-of-stability-and-reliability.html)
is hard. We always aim to deliver the highest quality work, but we try to avoid
perfectionism undermining our ultimate goals.

#### We will

* Spend the extra time to get something right.
* Make time to revisit and improve things over time.

#### We will not

Iterate forever. Some things really are “done”, and we move on.

### Focus

As a small team, everything we work on matters and should contribute to our
mission and goals. There are no small projects. If you don't understand how
what you are working on fits into our goals, then you're either haven't been
given the context you need or aren't doing the right thing.

Our time and energy are the resources that matter most. Say no to the projects
that don't contribute to the mission.

#### We will

Discuss how every proposed project contributes to the company mission. Say no
to new ideas that take us away from our focus.

#### We will not

Stray into areas away from our core focus without discussing how they meet the
mission.

### Mission driven

We acknowledge that in life there are many different perspectives and that
healthy debate is important for society. However, whilst we may all agree about
the existence of a problem, we expect people to have different opinions about
how to solve it.

Following the example of
[Coinbase](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804),
we refrain from advocating for causes unrelated to our mission because we
believe it [harms
inclusion](https://www.ethicalsystems.org/new-evidence-that-british-workplaces-are-losing-viewpoint-diversity/).
We are building a community for developers. Anything outside of that mission
should be discussed in person, not on company systems like chat or email.

#### We will

* Create an environment of inclusion for everyone where we can all feel
  welcome, safe, and able to work together towards our company goals.
* Support the freedom of our team to engage with issues outside of work through
  groups and activism as well as personal media like your own blog, Twitter,
  Signal, etc.

#### We will not

* Engage with broader societal, policy, and political issues unrelated to our
  mission.
* Use company systems such as chat and email to discuss or debate broader
  societal issues unrelated to our mission.
